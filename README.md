Intent detection is a crucial task in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and speech recognition.
It involves identifying the underlying intention or purpose of a spoken or written statement. This task
is particularly important in the development of voice assistants and other audio-based applications, as it
allows the system to understand and respond appropriately to the user’s requests and commands.
In the context of audio intent detection, the system must be able to accurately interpret the user’s spoken words and determine their intended meaning. This requires the system to have a deep understanding
of language and context, as well as the ability to recognize and differentiate between different intents or
purposes.
